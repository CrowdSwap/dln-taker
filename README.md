# DLN executor

DLN executor is the rule-based daemon service developed to automatically execute orders placed on the deSwap Liquidity Network (DLN) across supported blockchains.

## About

In a nutshell, DLN is an on-chain system of smart contracts where users (we call them *makers*) place their cross-chain exchange orders, giving a specific amount of input token on the source chain (`giveAmount` of the `giveToken` on the `giveChain`) and specifying the outcome they are willing to take on the destination chain (`takeAmount` of the `takeToken` on the `takeChain`). The given amount is being locked by the DLN smart contract on the source chain, and anyone with enough liquidity (called *takers*) can attempt to fulfill the order by calling the DLN smart contract on the destination chain supplying requested amount of tokens the *maker* is willing to take. After the order is being fulfilled, a cross-chain message is sent to the source chain via the deBridge protocol to unlock the funds, effectively completing the order.

This package is intended to automate the process of order execution: it listens for new orders coming into DLN, filters out those that satisfy custom criteria defined in the config (for example, expected profitability, amount cap, etc), attempts to fulfill them and unlocks funds.

## Installation

Download the source code from Github, picking the specific version:

```sh
git clone --depth 1 --single-branch --branch v0.2.0 git@github.com:debridge-finance/market-maker-executor.git
```

`cd` to the directory and install non-development dependencies:

```sh
cd market-maker-executor
npm install --prod
```

Create a configuration file based on the sample:

```sh
cp sample.config.ts executor.config.ts
```

Configure networks to listen to, define rules to filter out orders, set the wallets with the liquidity to fulfill orders with (see the next [section](#configuration)), then launch the executor specifying the name of the configuration file:

```sh
npm run executor --config executor.config.ts
```

This will keep the executor up and running, listening for new orders and executing those that satisfy the rules. A detailed execution log would appear in the console.


## Configuration

The config file should represent a Typescript module which exports an Object conforming the [`ExecutorConfig`](src/config.ts) type. This section describes how to configure its properties to be defined explicitly.


### Orders feed

The executor engine must have the source of new orders that are being placed on the DLN smart contracts. There can be different sources feeding the flow of orders (e.g. RPC node, RabbitMQ, etc). deBridge maintains and provides a highly efficient websocket server for speedy order delivery, which is a good way to process new orders, though you can implement your own order feed using the `IOrderFeed` interface.

```ts
const config: ExecutorConfig = {
    // use the ws address provided by deBridge.
    // Could be the IOrderFeed implementation as well
    orderFeed: "ws://127.0.0.1/ws",
}
```

### Order validators

As soon as the executor engine obtains the next order to execute, it passes it through the set of explicitly defined rules called *validators* before making an attempt to fulfill it. Each validator is just a simple async function which accepts an instance of the given order, and returns a boolean result indicating the approval. If, and only if each and every validator has approved the order, it is being passed to fulfillment.

Validators can be attached globally to the `orderValidators` property, which means they will be called when executing an order from/to any supported chains. This is a useful way to define constraints applicable to all supported chains. For example, let's define the global expected profitability of an order:

```ts
const config: ExecutorConfig = {
    orderValidators: [
        orderIsProfitable(4 /*bps*/),
        // ...
    ],
}
```

Validators can be additionally applied per supported chain, giving the flexibility to set tight constraints on chain-specific context, for example filtering out orders whose input `giveToken` is from the given white list or whose USD equivalent of the outcome (`takeAmount`) is within a specific range:

```ts
const config: ExecutorConfig = {
    chains: [
        {
            chain: ChainId.BSC,

            orderValidators: [
                // if the order is coming from BNB chain, accept it only if BUSD is the giveToken
                whitelistedGiveToken([
                    '0xe9e7CEA3DedcA5984780Bafc599bD69ADd087D56'
                ]),

                // fulfill orders on BNB only if the requested amount from $0 to $10,000
                takeAmountDollarEquiv(0, 10_000),
            ],
        }
    ]
}
```

The engine provides a handy set of built in validators to cover most cases that may arise during fine tuning of the order executor. This section covers all of them.


#### `srcChainDefined`

Checks if the source chain for the given order is defined in the config. This validator is made for convenience because it won't be possible to fulfill an order if its source chain is not defined in the configuration file.

#### `dstChainDefined`

Checks if the destination chain for the given order is defined in the config. This validator is made for convenience because it won't be possible to fulfill an order if its destination chain is not defined in the configuration file.

#### `disableFulfill()`

Prevents orders coming to the given chain from fulfillment. This validator is useful to filter off orders that are targeted to the chain you don't want to fulfill in, which is still needed to be presented in the configuration file to enable orders coming from this chain.

For example, you may want to fulfill orders on Solana and Ethereum, accepting orders coming from Solana, Ethereum, and Avalanche (but not others): this is possible by configuring:
- fulfillment rules for Solana and Ethereum,
- unlocking rules for Solana, Ethereum and Avalanche, and
- explicitly disabling fulfillment in Avalanche:

```ts
const config: ExecutorConfig = {
    chains: [
        {
            chain: ChainId.Avalanche,

            orderValidators: [
                disableFulfill()
            ],
        },

        {
            chain: ChainId.Solana,

            orderValidators: [],
        },

        {
            chain: ChainId.Ethereum,

            orderValidators: [],
        },
    ]
}
```


#### `orderProfitable(profitabilityBps: number)`

Checks if the USD equivalent of the order's unlock amount (amount given by the maker upon order creation, deducted by the fees) is the given [basis points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point) more than the USD equivalent of the order requested amount.

For example, assume a user places an order giving 1 ETH (â‰ˆ$1500) and requesting 4.95 BNB (â‰ˆ$1485). Such order has profitability of 5 bps (0.05%), so it will be approved by the validator setting of `profitabilityBps`=4 and won't be approved by the validator setting of `profitabilityBps`=6.

We suggest keeping the profitability of 4 bps:

```ts
    orderValidators: [
        orderIsProfitable(4 /*bps*/),
    ],
```

#### `giveAmountUSDEquivalentBetween(minUSDEquivalent: number, maxUSDEquivalent: number)`

Checks if the USD equivalent of the order's unlock amount (amount given by the maker upon order creation, deducted by the fees) is in the given range. This validator is useful to filter off uncomfortable volumes, e.g. too low (e.g. less than $10) or too high (e.g., more than $100,000).

```ts
    orderValidators: [
        // accept orders with unlock amounts >$10 and <$100K
        giveAmountUSDEquivalentBetween(10, 100_000),
    ],
```

#### `takeAmountUSDEquivalentBetween(minUSDEquivalent: number, maxUSDEquivalent: number)`

Checks if the USD equivalent of the order's requested amount (amount that should be supplied to fulfill the order successfully) is in the given range. This validator is useful to filter off uncomfortable volumes, e.g. too low (e.g. less than $10) or too high (e.g., more than $100,000).

```ts
    orderValidators: [
        // accept orders with unlock amounts >$10 and <$100K
        takeAmountUSDEquivalentBetween(10, 100_000),
    ],
```

#### `whitelistedMaker(addresses: string[])`

Checks if the address who placed the order on the source chain is in the whitelist. This validator is useful to filter out orders placed by the trusted parties.

#### `whitelistedTaker(addresses: string[])`

Checks if the order explicitly restricts fulfillment with the specific address which is in the given whitelist. This validator is useful to target OTC-like orders routed through DLN.

#### `whitelistedGiveToken(addresses: string[])`

Checks if the order's locked token is in the whitelist. This validator is useful to target orders that hold only liquid tokens (e.g., ETH, USDC, etc).

```ts
const config: ExecutorConfig = {
    chains: [
        {
            chain: ChainId.Ethereum,

            orderValidators: [
                // if the order is coming from Ethereum chain, accept ETH and USDT only
                whitelistedGiveToken([
                    '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
                    '0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7'
                ]),
            ],
        }
    ]
}
```

#### `blacklistedGiveToken(addresses: string[])`

Checks if the order's locked token is not in the blacklist. This validator is useful to filter off orders that hold undesired and/or illiquid tokens.

#### `whitelistedTakeToken(addresses: string[])`

Checks if the order's requested token is in the whitelist. This validator is useful to target orders that request specific tokens.

#### `blacklistedTakeToken(addresses: string[])`

Checks if the order's requested token is not in the blacklist. This validator is useful to filter off orders that requested undesired and/or illiquid tokens.

#### Custom validator

Developing custom validator requires a basic knowledge of Javascript and preferably Typescript. All you need is to define an async function that conforms the [`OrderValidator`](src/config.ts) type. For example, a validator that checks if the order's receiver address (the address where the funds would be sent to) is known:

```ts
export function receiverKnown(addresses: string[]): OrderValidator {
  return async (order: OrderData, pmmClient: PMMClient, config: ExecutorConfig) => {
    return order.receiver === KNOWN_RECEIVER;
  }
}
```

Then this validator can be used in the configuration:

```ts
    orderValidators: [
        receiverKnown("0x123...890")
    ],
```

### Order processor

After the order has been passed the validation, the executor attempts to fulfill the order running the selector order processor. An order processor implements the fulfillment strategy. The DLN executor provides a basic set of extensible processor, that you can use depending on your needs.

A processor can be attached globally to the `orderProcessor` property, which means it will be used for processing valid orders on all supported chains, or it can be set per chain:

```ts
const config: ExecutorConfig = {
    // use processor1 for all chains defined in this list
    orderProcessor: processor1(),

    chains: [
        {
            chain: ChainId.Ethereum,
        },
        {
            chain: ChainId.Solana,
        },

        {
            chain: ChainId.BSC,

            // explicitly use processor2 for BNB chain
            orderProcessor: processor2()
        },
    ]
}
```

#### `StrictProcessor()` (default)

A very basic processor attempts to fulfill orders that request tokens presented on the taker's `wallet` (used by the executor to fulfill the orders). For example, if the taker's `wallet` have only ETH and USDT on the given chain, this processor will try to process orders that request ETH and USDT skipping orders that request other tokens (say, USDC).

#### `PreswapProcessor()`

This processor attempts to fulfill orders making an atomic swap of the minimum necessary amount of tokens being held on the taker's wallet (we call it *taker's reserve token*) to receive the amount of tokens requested by the order and attempt to fulfill the order in a single transaction. If either swap of fulfill fails, the whole transaction gets reverted.

### Supported chains

DLN is a cross-chain solution, and since each chain has its own peculiarities, you must explicitly define each chain where the orders you as a taker would like to execute are coming from/to. Even if you are going to fulfill orders in one particular chain (e.g., Solana), you MUST configure other chains you are ready process order from (e.g., Ethereum) to support order unlocking.

For example, you want to fulfill orders on Solana and Ethereum, accepting orders coming from Solana, Ethereum, and Avalanche (but not others): this is possible by configuring:
- fulfillment rules for Solana and Ethereum,
- unlocking rules for Solana, Ethereum and Avalanche, and
- explicitly disabling fulfillment in Avalanche.

DLN executor gives you a wide range of configuration options to meet your specific needs. To define chains, use the `chains` property to list all chains you are willing the executor to process:

```ts
const config: ExecutorConfig = {
    chains: [
        {/* chain 1 */},

        {/* chain ... */},

        {/* chain N */},
    ]
}
```

Each chain must contain a list of network-, chain- and taker-related stuff.

#### Network related configuration

For each chain, you must define it's ID and the url to the RPC node:

```ts
    chains: [
        {
            chain: ChainId.Solana,
            chainRpc: "https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com/",
        },
    ]
```

#### Chain related configuration

A configuration engine preserves a list of defaults representing the mainnet deployments of the DLN smart contracts per each chain. For example, it is well known that the address of the core `deBridgeGate` contract across supported EVM chains is `0x43dE2d77BF8027e25dBD179B491e8d64f38398aA`. However, if you are running the executor against non-production environment, you might have received the list of applicable addresses that must override these defaults.

```ts
    chains: [
        {
            chain: ChainId.Solana,
            chainRpc: "https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com/",

            // { this should not be presented in the real world config: mainnet addresses are defined in the internals
                pmmSrc: "srcTG7YiZkebpJJaCQEuqBznRYqrfcj8a917EcMnNUk",
                pmmDst: "dstFoo3xGxv23giLZBuyo9rRwXHdDMeySj7XXMj1Rqn",
                deBridge: "F1nSne66G8qCrTVBa1wgDrRFHMGj8pZUZiqgxUrVtaAQ",
                deBridgeSettings: "14bkTTDfycEShjiurAv1yGupxvsQcWevReLNnpzZgaMh",
            // }

        },
    ]
```

#### Taker related configuration

> **Caution!** Properties from this section define sensitive data used by the DLN executor to operate funds.

The `beneficiary` property defines taker controlled address where the orders (fulfilled on the other chains) would unlock the funds to.

The `wallet` property defines the private key for the wallet with the funds to fulfill orders. The DLN executor will sign transactions on behalf of this wallet.

```ts
const config: ExecutorConfig = {
    chains: [
        {
            chain: ChainId.Solana,

            // if the order is created on Solana and fulfilled on Ethereum,
            // unlocked funds will be sent to this Solana address
            beneficiary: "F1nSne66G8qCrTVBa1wgDrRFHMGj8pZUZiqgxUrVtaAQ",

            // if the order is created on Ethereum, DLN executor would attempt to
            // fulfill such order on behalf of this wallet
            wallet: "...",
        },

        {
            chain: ChainId.Ethereum,


            // if the order is created on Ethereum and fulfilled on Solana,
            // unlocked funds will be sent to this Ethereum address
            beneficiary: "0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045",

            // if the order is created on Solana, DLN executor would attempt to
            // fulfill such order on behalf of this wallet
            wallet: "...",
        },
    ]
}
```


## Price service

Most built in validators and rules applied to orders depend on the current market price of the tokens involved in the order. It is possible to set up a custom service responsible for obtaining current market prices, by setting the `priceTokenService` property:

```ts
const config: ExecutorConfig = {
    priceTokenService: new CoingeckoPriceFeed(apiKey),
}
```
